# Pull Request Consolidation Strategy

## Overview
We have 8+ open PRs that can be strategically consolidated to reduce repository clutter while maintaining code quality.

## Current Open PRs Analysis

### 1. Code Quality PRs (Ready for Sequential Merge)

#### PR #129 - Fix all ESLint issues causing CI failures ✅ **MERGE FIRST**
- **Status**: Comprehensive ESLint fixes
- **Changes**: 
  - Replace `||` with `??` for null coalescing
  - Update index signatures to `Record<string, T>`
  - Replace `Array<T>` with `T[]`
  - Fix unsafe `any` types
  - Remove unused variables
- **Impact**: 13 files modified, improves code quality
- **Ready**: Yes, all changes are safe improvements

#### PR #130 - Fix CI test runner conflicts ✅ **MERGE SECOND**  
- **Status**: Fixes Vitest/Playwright conflicts
- **Changes**:
  - Fix Jest vs Vitest mocks (`jest.fn()` → `vi.fn()`)
  - Separate unit and E2E tests
  - Update CI workflow
- **Impact**: 5 files modified, fixes CI pipeline
- **Depends on**: PR #129 (shares some ESLint changes)

#### PR #128 - Fix TypeScript strict mode compliance ✅ **MERGE THIRD**
- **Status**: TypeScript improvements 
- **Changes**: Similar to #129 but more focused on TypeScript
- **Impact**: Type safety improvements
- **Note**: May have overlap with #129, review for conflicts

### 2. Piano Diagram PRs (Can be Consolidated)

- **Changes**: Visual styling improvements
- **Impact**: CSS and component structure updates

#### PR #119 - refactor: use shared piano diagram  
- **Changes**: Code consolidation for piano components
- **Impact**: Reduces code duplication

#### PR #120 - Use chord theme color by default in piano diagram
- **Changes**: Color theming improvements
- **Impact**: UI consistency

**Consolidation Opportunity**: These 3 PRs all modify piano diagram functionality and could be merged into a single comprehensive piano diagram improvement.

### 3. Feature PRs (Review Individually)

#### PR #121 - feat: make root note color configurable
- **Status**: Feature enhancement
- **Impact**: Adds customization capability
- **Action**: Review for merge readiness

#### PR #111 - fix: update song practice instrument panel usage  
- **Status**: Bug fix
- **Action**: Review and potentially merge

## Recommended Merge Sequence

### Phase 1: Code Quality Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Merge PR #129** (ESLint fixes) - Establishes clean code baseline
2. **Merge PR #130** (CI fixes) - Ensures reliable testing
3. **Merge PR #128** (TypeScript) - Adds type safety (check for conflicts with #129)

### Phase 2: Feature Consolidation (Week 2)  
4. **Consolidate Piano PRs (#118, #119, #120)** into single comprehensive change
5. **Review and merge PR #121** (root note color) if ready
6. **Review and merge PR #111** (song practice fix) if ready

### Phase 3: Branch Cleanup (Week 3)
7. **Delete stale codex/ branches** (30+ branches identified)
8. **Delete merged/completed copilot/ branches**
9. **Review remaining feature branches**

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Prepare for Code Quality Merges
```bash
# Test PR #129 changes locally
gh pr checkout 129
npm run build && npm test && npm run lint

# Test PR #130 changes  
gh pr checkout 130
npm run build && npm test:unit && npm run test:e2e

# Check for conflicts between PRs
git merge-tree $(git merge-base main origin/pr-129-branch) origin/pr-129-branch origin/pr-130-branch
```

### 2. Create Consolidated Piano PR
```bash
# Create new branch for consolidated piano changes
git checkout main
git checkout -b consolidate/piano-diagram-improvements

# Cherry-pick changes from PRs #118, #119, #120
# Review and test combined changes
# Submit as single PR replacing the three separate ones
```

### 3. Safe Branch Deletion
```bash
# Delete codex branches older than 7 days with no open PRs
git branch -r | grep 'codex/' | while read branch; do
  # Check age and PR status before deleting
  git push origin --delete ${branch#origin/}
done
```

## Success Metrics

### Before Cleanup
- **Branches**: 47
- **Open PRs**: 8+
- **ESLint errors**: Present
- **CI issues**: Failing tests

### After Cleanup (Target)
- **Branches**: ~12-15
- **Open PRs**: ~3-4
- **ESLint errors**: 0
- **CI status**: All green
- **Code quality**: Improved type safety and consistency

## Risk Mitigation

### Testing Strategy
1. **Each PR tested individually** before merge
2. **Integration testing** after each merge
3. **Manual validation** of key functionality
4. **Rollback plan** for each change

### Change Management
1. **Sequential merging** to isolate issues
2. **Continuous monitoring** of CI/CD
3. **Stakeholder communication** about changes
4. **Documentation updates** as needed

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Code quality PRs (#129, #130, #128)
- **Week 2**: Feature consolidation and review
- **Week 3**: Branch cleanup and final optimization
- **Week 4**: Monitoring and stabilization

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer active PRs to track
2. **Improved Quality**: Better ESLint compliance and TypeScript safety  
3. **Cleaner Repository**: Reduced branch clutter
4. **Better CI/CD**: Reliable test execution
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Consolidated related changes
